Hi, I'm Anand. I'm a software developer living in Sydney, Australia. I've been
in the industry for 15 years, and have worked on a variety of projects from
operating systems to web browsers.

I decided to start this blog to write about some ideas I've been exploring.
Really, this blog is for me. I've found writing to be a good way of organising
my thoughts, and forces me to look at problems from another angle.
